- How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I start by understanding the problem I want to solve and breaking it down into smaller components. I focus on creating clear, modular structures that make the program easier to maintain and extend. I also consider user needs and the overall flow of the application to ensure the design supports a smooth experience.
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft

This project helped me develop stronger skills in organizing complex scenes and managing multiple objects and their interactions in a 3D space. I learned how to apply textures and materials effectively and how to plan the rendering process in a logical sequence, which improved my ability to visualize the software architecture and data flow.
- What design process did you follow for your project work?

I began with sketching out the main components and the relationships between objects, followed by defining how each part would be rendered and updated. I iterated on this design as I added more features, such as lighting and textures, refining the architecture to improve performance and clarity.
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The approach of modular design and iterative refinement is something I plan to apply in future projects, whether they involve graphics, game development, or any other software domain. Breaking down complex problems and incrementally improving the design helps me manage scope and adapt to changes more easily.
- How do I approach developing programs?

I develop programs by starting with basic functionality and gradually adding complexity. I rely heavily on testing each part as I build it to ensure correctness. I also document my code and keep the structure clean to avoid confusion as the program grows.
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

While working on the 3D scene, I adopted a more systematic approach to applying transformations and managing scene objects. I also made use of iterative debugging and visual feedback to verify object placements and lighting effects, which helped me catch and fix issues earlier.
- How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was critical to my development process. I would implement a feature, test it, identify bugs or improvements, and then refine the code. This cycle repeated many times, especially with physics calculations and collision detection, allowing me to gradually improve the realism and responsiveness of the scene.
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Initially, I focused on getting basic rendering working, but as I progressed through milestones, I shifted towards optimizing code structur. This evolution helped me write cleaner, more maintainable code and better manage project complexity.
- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and technical knowledge that are essential for creating innovative solutions. It also opens opportunities in fields like software development, game design, and visualization, which align with my personal and professional aspirations.
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Learning computational graphics has also improved my ability to visualize abstract concepts, aiding my comprehension in fields like simulation, robotics, and data visualization.
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Professionally, these skills enable me to create engaging user interfaces, immersive experiences, and realistic simulations. Whether working in gaming, virtual reality, or software development, the ability to manipulate graphics and visualize data will allow me to build more effective and visually compelling products.
